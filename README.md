# CRM-Users
The CRM-Users is a microservice part of the CRM Service. Its domain is to manage users including Authorization and Authentication.
Zuul is integrated in order to filter according to the user credentials.

## Getting started

In order to run the application, you will need to add the JASYPT_PASSWORD environment variable. Please, ask the creator in order to provide it.
After that, you will only need to run the "docker-compose" that is located under resources, in order to run a MySQL instance and create the database.
If you want to run all the "CRM Service" applications at the same time, you will have to run only one "docker-compose" and create manually the other databases. For example, if you run "docker-compose up" in "crm-users", you will need to create manually the "crm-documents" and "crm-customers" databases.

### REST API documentation

This documentation is available, when running the application, at the URL: http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html
